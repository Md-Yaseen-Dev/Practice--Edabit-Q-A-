// First Class, Second Class and Third Class Levers
// Levers are simple machines with a rigid beam and a fulcrum. From the picture below, you can see that there are 3-types of levers: first class, second class and third class.

// In a first class lever, the fulcrum is situated in the middle with the effort and the load being positioned opposite of each other.
// In a second class lever, the fulcrum is situated in the right with the effort on the left and the load in the middle.
// In a third class lever, the fulcrum is situated in the left with the effort being in the middle and the load being on the right.


// Given an array that contains the fulcrum "f", the effort "e", and the load "l", write a function that determines whether or not the array shows a first class lever, second class lever, or a third class lever.

// Examples
// determineLever(["e", "f", "l"]) ➞ "first class lever"

// determineLever(["e", "l", "f"]) ➞ "second class lever"

// determineLever(["f", "e", "l"]) ➞ "third class lever"
// Notes
// A pair of scissors is a first class lever, a nutcracker is a second class lever and a broom is a third class lever.

function determineLever(arr) {

    
    return ((arr[1] == "f") ? `first class level` : (arr[1] == "l") ? `second class level` : (arr[1] == "e") ? `third class level` : "invalid input")

}
console.log(determineLever(["e", "f", "l"]));
console.log(determineLever(["e", "l", "f"]));
console.log(determineLever(["f", "e", "l"]));
